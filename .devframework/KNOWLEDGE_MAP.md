# Transfer map — Main OS to new projects

Reviewed: 2026-08-31. This is the coverage ledger, not another rulebook. Canonical rules
and recipes are linked and installed locally; Main OS is not needed to use them.
Transferred means a design/failure-test contract, not consumer implementation or proof
the source implementation was universally correct.

## Source boundary and fingerprints

Source checkout HEAD: `796d7f099e6eb6d479ac2c3982be884c45f002a3`. Hashes identify working
files, not a claim they equal HEAD. Paths below are source-relative references, not broken
links to missing generated-project files. Historical counts/dates are provenance.

## Transferred failure classes

Checks are consumer acceptance criteria unless explicitly named package tests. They guide
implementation, not runtime coverage claims from Markdown.

## Deliberate exclusions and unreviewed material

- Exact WPF panels/aliases, SQLite pragma constants, Android commands, personal paths and
  account identifiers are not universal defaults. Transfer the invariant and require an
  applicable stack profile with its own measured/verified implementation.
- Model-attribution collectors, Main OS feature catalog and language-specific gate source
  are not ported. Transcript adapters cannot reliably infer unknown authorship.
- Private logs, credentials, user records and provider-private memory are not copied.
- Other documents, unnamed known-error entries and the full historical Git corpus have
  NOT been exhaustively audited. Do not describe this as "all Main OS proven covered".
  Discoveries first receive a source selection/K-NNN row, then a recipe and negative test.
- The source refactor plan has historical phase/status claims. Transfer its contract, not
  a claim that a server deploy/live smoke actually passed.

Before a new project: select applicable K rows, name owners in architecture/invariants,
link real tests/telemetry, and record deferred/rejected rows with reasons. Package tests
verify map structure/local destinations only; maintainers review semantic coverage.
